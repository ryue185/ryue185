- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryue185, an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago
- 👀 Here will be used to store data analysis stuff on Finance related projects from research assistant works 
- ♻️ And random bits of code that I decide to keep around and not throw away
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Python, C, SQL and stuff
- 📫 Reach me at ryue@uchicago.edu
- 📦 Contained in the ryue185 repository are some micellaneous code that doesn't warrant its own repository
-------
- CEX.R is part of a project from RA work I have been doing. I use R to extract relevant columns from Consumer Expenditure Surveys(CEX), a large, online, publicly available data set, to complete graphs and computation relevant to my RA project. Though it may not be super sophisticated, it is a testament to my ability to access online databases efficiently with code and process large datasets. 
-------
- wordcounting.py is the fruit of me playing around with some basic tools in python to do some simple textual analysis. The functions defined in this file take text in a string and do word counts, sentence counts, and find the words' length
