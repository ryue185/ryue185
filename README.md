- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryue185, an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago
- 👀 Here will be used to store data analysis stuff on Finance related projects from research assistant works 
- ♻️ And random bits of code that I decide to keep around and not throw away
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Python, C, SQL and stuff
- 📫 Reach me at ryue@uchicago.edu

- CEX.R is part of a project from RA work I have been doing. I use R to extract relevant columns from Consumer Expenditure Surveys(CEX), a large, online, publicly available data set, to complete graphs and computation relevant to my RA project. Though it may not be super sophisticated, it is a testament to my ability to access online databases efficiently with code and process large datasets.
