- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryue185, an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago
- 👀 Here will be used to store data analysis stuff on Finance related projects from research assistant works 
- ♻️ And random bits of code that I decide to keep around and not throw away
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Python, C, SQL and stuff
- 📫 Reach me at ryue@uchicago.edu
-------
- CEX.R is a part of a project from RA work I have been doing. I use R to extract relevant columns from a large, online, publicly available data set to complete graphs and computation relevant for the RA project. Though it is simple, it is a testament to my ability to access online databases with code and process large datasets.
