**Miscellaneous Files Explanations**
------- 
- CEX.R is part of a project from RA work I have been doing. I use R to extract relevant columns from Consumer Expenditure Surveys(CEX), a large, online, publicly available data set, to complete graphs and computation relevant to my RA project. Though it may not be super sophisticated, it is a testament to my ability to access online databases efficiently with code and process large datasets.  
------- 
- wordcounting.py is the fruit of me playing around with some basic tools in python to do some simple textual analysis. The functions defined in this file take text in a string and do word counts, sentence counts, and find the words' length
--------
- Ecma final demo is a condensed verion of the R code I wrote for ECMA 3132, a masters level class in econometrics and data science class I took during my junior yeat at the University of Chicago. It is used for retrieving data from the BLS and analyzing it with a Diff-in-Diff methodology for the final paper of that class.
--------
- life_cycle is a plot I made in RA work that I really liked. It shows how individual's annual credit card consumption change over the life time by overlaying lines representing different age groups together. The plot here represents the attached csv file, which is a modified version of the original data file I worked with (only selected columns, all entry values were changed to mask information). I cannot include the original file, both because it is too large and because it is private data.
